  Shoppers meandered through NorthPark Center. Some carried big red Macy’s bags that proclaimed, in bold white script, “Believe.” But Casen Hagans, 11, wasn’t sure he should.
</p>

<p id="story">
  In line to see Santa Claus, Casen turned to his mother and quietly expressed concern.
</p>
<p id="story">
  “You sure this is the real deal?”
</p>
<p id="story">
  He’s in fifth grade, and in a few Christmases, he’ll be taller than his mother. His green-and-black striped sweater matched his little brother’s. The sleeves were just a little too long.
</p>
<p id="story">
  Casen’s mother assured him this was, in fact, the Santa, while his 7-year-old brother and 9-year-old sister peeked around the corner to get a glimpse of the Big Man.

<p class="caption">Despite harboring doubts about whether he was the 'real deal,' 11-year-old Casen Hagans delivered this Christmas wish list to Santa Claus at NorthPark Center.
</p>
<p id="story">
  Casen still had questions.
</p>
<p id="story">
  Shouldn’t Santa be at his workshop at this time in December? How is he getting his work done?
</p>
<p id="story">
  How does he get around the world in one night? Sure, he has flying reindeer, but still...
</p>
<p id="story">
  A velvet rope was unclipped, and Casen stepped toward the man with the bushy white beard and twinkling blue eyes.
</p>
<p id="story">
  Belief ... and bicycles
</p>
<p id="story">
  This year, Casen wrote his list in red marker on a piece of white paper with a festive red-and-white border. He held it in his right hand while sitting next to Santa. He still had doubts — “about 50/50,” he would later say — but the old man’s warm smile and bright eyes conveyed a certain magic of their own.

  He asked for Texas Tech football tickets and a kicking tee, but what he really wants is a new bicycle, the grown-up kind with gears.
</p>
<p id="story">
  Santa waved goodbye and wished the family a Merry Christmas. He carefully placed the letters from Casen and his siblings in a side table. Casen and his family ran off to continue their shopping at the Disney Store.
</p>
<p id="story">
  As they walked away, Casen looked toward the sparkling sign outside Macy’s: “Believe.” He hoped Santa got the message: A bike with gears, please.
